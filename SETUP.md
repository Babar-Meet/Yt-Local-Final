## 🚀 Quick Start - For Beginners

If you have **no prior technical knowledge**, follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Prerequisites

You need to have **Node.js** installed on your computer. If you don't have it:

1. Go to [Node.js Download Page](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version (recommended for most users)
3. Run the downloaded installer
4. Click "Next" through all the screens
5. Finish the installation

### Step 2: Installation

1. Extract the project files to a folder on your computer
2. Find the `install.bat` file (in the main project folder)
3. Double-click on `install.bat` to run it
4. A black window will open - don't close it!
5. The installation will take a few minutes (be patient)
6. When you see "Installation complete!", press any key to close the window

### Step 3: Run the Application

You have two options to run the application:

#### Option A: Desktop Application (Recommended)

1. Find the `run-electron.bat` file
2. Double-click on `run-electron.bat` to run it
3. The application will start in a new window
4. You can use it like any other desktop app

#### Option B: Browser Version

1. Find the `run-browser.bat` file
2. Double-click on `run-browser.bat` to run it
3. A browser window will automatically open
4. If not, visit http://localhost:5000

**Note**: If you see permission errors, try right-clicking the .bat file and selecting "Run as administrator".

## 📖 Detailed Instructions

### Installation Script - install.bat

This script automatically:
1. Checks if Node.js is installed
2. Installs root dependencies (Electron)
3. Installs backend dependencies
4. Installs frontend dependencies

You only need to run this **once**.

### Desktop Application - run-electron.bat

This script:
1. Checks dependencies are installed
2. Ensures frontend is built
3. Starts the Electron desktop application

Features:
- Native desktop experience
- Better performance
- Full screen support
- Background downloads

### Browser Version - run-browser.bat

This script:
1. Builds the frontend (if needed)
2. Starts the backend server
3. Opens the application in your default browser

Features:
- Works on any modern browser
- Easy sharing between devices
- No installation required once dependencies are set up

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Node.js is not installed" error**
- Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
- Restart your computer after installation

**2. Permission errors**
- Always run batch files as administrator
- Right-click → "Run as administrator"

**3. Installation takes too long**
- Check your internet connection
- The first installation may take 5-10 minutes
- Subsequent runs are much faster

**4. Port 5000 is already in use**
- Close any other applications using port 5000
- Or restart your computer

### Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

If the batch files don't work for you, you can install manually:

```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install
cd ..

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### Manual Startup

```bash
# Run desktop application
npm start

# Or run browser version
cd backend
node server.js
# Open browser to http://localhost:5000
```
